Herein are described the coding standards that should be adopted in this project:
- indentation using tabs
- line length limit is 90 columns
- no more than one statement per line
- catch exceptions
- don't catch broad exception classes (i.e. Exception)
- use disambiguated variable names (i.e. avoid names like "data" or "flag")
- use disambiguated method names (i.e. avoid names with "process" or "handle")
- use comments where code behaviour can be unclear or obfuscated
- leave two blank lines between each function
- constants should be written in capital letters (i.e. "MAX_ITEMS")
